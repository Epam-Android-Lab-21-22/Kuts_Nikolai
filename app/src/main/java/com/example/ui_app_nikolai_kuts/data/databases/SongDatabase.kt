                Puede ser debilidad
                El tiempo se me va
                Nunca fui tan incapaz de dejar atrás
                Algo que en realidad solo me hacía mal
                
                Me dejé llevar por la corriente
                La ilusión jugo contra mi mente
                Alejándome de todo lo que soy y quiero ser
                
                Recogí pedazos del espejo
                Para ver de nuevo mi reflejo
                Y en la libertad mis colores vuelven a brillar
                
                Cambio de piel
                Me dejo ver
                Cambio de piel
                Soy yo de nuevo
                Bajo la lluvia, el sol salió
                Y mi alma floreció
                
                Sé que muy normal, no soy
                Pero todo doy
                Puedo ser un huracán dulce como el mar
                
                Soy una mujer leal
                Algo territorial
                Frágil como un volcán cuando va a estallar
                
                Debe ser difícil complacerme
                Debe ser complejo entenderme
                No hay mejor verdad que esa que no quieres escuchar
                Yo no quise abandonar mi alma, no quise vivir como un fantasma
                Y en la libertad mis colores vuelven a brillar
                
                Cambio de piel
                Me dejo ver
                Cambio de piel
                Soy yo de nuevo
                Bajo la lluvia el sol salió
                Y mi alma floreció
